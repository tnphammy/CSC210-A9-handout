## Reflection

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
Debugging BSTs can be much more complex than LinkedList, even though they are kind of the same thing, but there is so many things/cases I need to worry about for BSTs. So trying to write the code cleanly, logically without making myself confused was among the biggest challenges. It helped to have a clear outline on paper, so that I would have to consider my understanding before implementing it into code – sometimes, code feels so easy,a little too easy to produce, so I forget about the quality of my ideas.

Any questions you still have? No.
